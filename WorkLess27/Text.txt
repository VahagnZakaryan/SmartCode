I'm Caroline Leavitt. I'm the New York Times bestselling author of two novels, Is This Tomorrow and Pictures of You and the critically acclaimed, Cruel Beautiful World as well as eight other novels. And I have a new novel coming out With or Without You, August 4th, 2020 from Algonquin Books.I want to talk to you all today about structuring your novel before you even start writing, which is something that I myself never did until about 10 years ago and it changed my life and I bet it'll change yours.
